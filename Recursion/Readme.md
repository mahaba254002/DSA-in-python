# Recursion
- It is a programming phenomena where a function calls itself to solve a particular problem.

 ## Rules of Recursion
 - A recursion must have a base case identifying where the function should terminate.It is the simplest possible problem instance .
 
 - A recursive case where a function calls itself


 ### Points to consider 
 - Recursive uses the call stack to store info about each recursive call.Each function consume memory in the stack[LIFO].
